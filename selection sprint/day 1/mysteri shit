CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

./interview-628618:1:Fits the profile, except for the make of his car.  Should be considered a suspect if and only if there is evidence Boyer owns a second car.

./interview-9620713:5:Considered a suspect until proven otherwise, but would have to eliminate other suspects to confirm.


./interview-862173:3:Does Waite own a second car?  If so, he may be a suspect.  Otherwise is not a suspect.
